# ps6-create-a-web-app
I have built my own shiny application. The application provides the user with the ability to interactively explore the dataset "UAH-lower-troposphere-long".
It has three sets of pages. One page (the opening page)displays the general information about the dataset, another page displays a plot, and the third
page displays a table.
Here is the link to my project--https://steven1.shinyapps.io/UAH-lower-troposphere-long/
